  * Mesh translation (GUI)
  * Mesh scaling (GUI)
  * Mesh rotation (GUI)
  * Mesh deletion (GUI)
  * Add new views on to the scene (GUI)

## Description ##
This is the first release of OViSE which will cover only the basics. That means the base GUI is present allowing multiple views on the scene. Additionally you can insert meshes into the scene and then transform them via the object properties grid. You can also remove mehses from the scene. Multiple selection works, but you cannot transform multiple object at once yet.
